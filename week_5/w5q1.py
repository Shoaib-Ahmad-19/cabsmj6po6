# A data automation team is creating a utility module that performs multiple 
# independent calculations based on user inputs. Write a Python program that 
# accepts required inputs from the user and defines separate functions to 
# perform: 
# • Find the largest of three numbers (positional arguments). 
# • Compute the volume based on user’s chosen shape: – cylinder (r, h), cube (a), or rectangular box (l, w, h). 
# • Compute the area of a rectangle. 
# • Compute the circumference of a circle. 
# • Exchange the values of two variables. 
# • Find the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using math.dist(). 
# (Use switch case to execute the required function)
